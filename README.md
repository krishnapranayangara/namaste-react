# JSX
    - JSX is not  valid Java Script but HTML like script that made react coding easier
    - JSX is not built in JS engine
    - JS Engine understands es6 - ECMAScript 6 and other versions of ECMAScript
    - Parcel Transpiles(to encode) JSX before going to JS Engine.
    - Parcel uses Babel(JS Compiler) to transpile JSX to JS Engine compatible ECMA Script
    - Babel can transpile/convert the code to browser compatible code 
    - JSX Takes care of Data injection attacks (cross-site Scripting attack)
